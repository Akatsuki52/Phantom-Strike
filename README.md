# Phantom Striker - Final Year Project Documentation

## Project Overview
**Project Title:** Phantom Striker

## Development Progress
As part of the initial development phase, I have implemented the following features:

### 1. Headbob Effect for Realistic Viewing
- **Description:** A headbob effect has been added to enhance the player's immersive experience while moving. This provides a more natural and realistic camera motion when walking or running.

### 2. Sprinting System
- **Description:** A sprinting mechanic has been introduced to allow the player to move at a faster pace while holding a designated key. This adds dynamism to movement and gameplay.

### 3. Crouching System
- **Description:** A crouch mechanic has been integrated to enable the player to crouch for stealth and navigation purposes, contributing to a more realistic movement system.

### 4. Change FOV When Sprinting
- **Description:** The Field of View (FOV) now dynamically changes when the player sprints, creating a more immersive and realistic sprinting experience.

### 6. Interactive Flashlight and Toggle Sound
- **Description:** A flashlight system has been implemented, allowing the player to toggle the flashlight on and off. Additionally, a sound effect plays when the flashlight is toggled for added realism.

## Current Status
As of now, the headbob, sprinting, crouching systems, FOV change when sprinting, camera shake when landing, and interactive flashlight with toggle sound have been implemented. No other major gameplay features or mechanics have been added yet. Further development will focus on additional movement mechanics, environment setup, enemy AI, weapon systems, and interactive elements.

## Next Steps
- Implement the first-person driving system.
- Design the road and colony of mansions.
- Integrate a police car with sirens.
- Begin developing AI for zombie enemies.
- Add interactive objects (medkits, keys, doors, etc.).

This document will be updated as development progresses.
